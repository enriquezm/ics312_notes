#Chapter One Notes

1. True or False. A program that combines object files into an executable program is called a linker.
  - `False`

2. True or False. In any numbering system, the radix specifies the range of alphanumeric digits that can be assigned to a single digit position.
  - `True`

3. True or False. The binary representation of decimal ```42``` is ```0010 1010```.
  - `True`

4. True or False. The hexadecimal representation of decimal ```33``` is ```33h```.
  - `False`

5. True or False. The sum of the binary integers ```01101101``` and ```00111011``` is ```10101001```.
  - `False`

6. True or False. The 8-bit two's complement of binary ```00000010``` is ```11111110```.
  - `True`

7. The binary representation of decimal ```-42``` is ```11010111```.


8. True or False. Suppose there is a virtual machine containing levels V1 and V2, where V2 is above V1 in the machine hierarchy. The program written in language V2 can be executed by a program running at level V1.

9. True or False. The sum of all powers of ```2``` from ```20``` to ```28``` is ```511```.

10. True or False. A dynamic link library (DLL) is never written in the Java programming language.

11. True or False. A compiler decodes and executes one program statement at a time.

12. True or False. A virtual machine may be constructed from software.

13. True or False. The sum of 3AB4h and 0429h is 3EDDh.

14. True or False. To translate an unsigned decimal integer into binary, repeatedly divide the integer by 2, saving each remainder as a binary digit.

15. True or False. The expression NOT X OR NOT Y is false when X is false and Y is true.
